# Game Engine Development Project

![Game Engine Logo](engine_logo.png)

## Overview

This GitHub repository documents my journey in creating my own game engine from scratch using a combination of online resources and my own coding knowledge in C++. The goal of this project is to develop a versatile and efficient game engine that can be used to create a wide range of 2D and 3D games.

## Introduction

Game engine development is a complex and rewarding endeavor. This project serves as both a personal learning experience and a way to share my progress and insights with the community. By building a game engine from scratch, I aim to gain a deep understanding of the fundamental principles of game development, graphics programming, physics simulation, and more.

## Features

As this project evolves, I plan to implement a wide range of features within the game engine. Some of the planned features include:

- **Rendering Engine**: Implementing a rendering engine capable of handling 2D and 3D graphics with support for modern graphics APIs like OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX.

- **Physics Engine**: Developing a physics engine for simulating realistic interactions between game objects, including collision detection and response.

- **Audio System**: Incorporating an audio system for playing sounds and music in the games created with the engine.

- **Asset Management**: Creating tools and systems for efficient loading, management, and rendering of game assets such as textures, models, and shaders.

- **Scripting**: Adding scripting support to allow game logic to be defined using scripting languages like Lua or Python.

- **Editor**: Building a user-friendly editor for designing levels, scenes, and game objects within the engine.

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensuring that the engine is cross-platform and can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **Documentation**: Providing extensive documentation to make it easy for others to understand and use the engine.

- **Examples and Tutorials**: Creating example projects and tutorials to help developers get started with the engine.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and the project will continue to evolve over time.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need:

- A C++ compiler compatible with C++17 or later.
- A development environment of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio, Xcode, or a Linux-based IDE).
- Knowledge of C++ programming and basic computer graphics concepts.

Here are the steps to build and run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/s4mmie/sourcecppgame

2. Build the project using your preferred development environment and compiler.

3. Run the sample applications provided in the repository to test the engine's functionality.

Please refer to the [documentation](docs/) for more detailed instructions on building and using the engine.

## Architecture

The engine's architecture is structured in a modular and extensible manner. Key components include:

- **Core**: The core module contains the fundamental building blocks of the engine, such as memory management, input handling, and timing.

- **Graphics**: This module is responsible for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. It interfaces with the underlying graphics API (e.g., OpenGL) to display visuals on the screen.

- **Physics**: The physics module handles collision detection and response, as well as simulating the physical behavior of objects within the game world.

- **Audio**: This module manages audio playback, including sounds and music, to provide a rich auditory experience in games.

- **Scripting**: The scripting module allows game logic to be scripted using a scripting language like Lua, providing flexibility in defining game behaviors.
